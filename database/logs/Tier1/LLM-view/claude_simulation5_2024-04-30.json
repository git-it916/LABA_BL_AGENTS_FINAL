The top 5 sectors with strong momentum and trend strength are Energy, Materials, Industrials, Health Care, and Information Technology. These sectors have shown consistent growth over the past year, indicating a strong trend. On the other hand, Real Estate, Consumer Discretionary, Utilities, and Financials have shown weaker momentum and trend strength, making them potential short candidates.\n\n( Stage 2: Accounting Data Analysis )\n\nUnfortunately, no accounting data was provided, so I did not incorporate it into my analysis.\n\n( Stage 3: Macro Data Analysis )\n\nSimilarly, no macro data was provided, so I did not consider it in my analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the 12-month returns, I selected the top 5 sector pairs with the highest expected relative returns. The top 5 pairs are Energy (Long) vs. Real Estate (Short), Materials (Long) vs. Consumer Discretionary (Short), Industrials (Long) vs. Utilities (Short), Health Care (Long) vs. Financials (Short), and Information Technology (Long) vs. Communication Services (Short)."
