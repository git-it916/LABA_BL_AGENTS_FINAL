The key factors that led me to select these pairs are:\n\n1. Energy sector: With a strong 3-year CAGR and a mean reversion signal indicating an oversold condition, Energy is a strong candidate for a Long position.\n2. Materials sector: With a weak 3-year CAGR and a mean reversion signal indicating an overbought condition, Materials is a strong candidate for a Short position.\n3. Industrials sector: With a strong 3-year CAGR and a mean reversion signal indicating an oversold condition, Industrials is a strong candidate for a Long position.\n4. Consumer Discretionary sector: With a weak 3-year CAGR and a mean reversion signal indicating an overbought condition, Consumer Discretionary is a strong candidate for a Short position.\n5. Health Care sector: With a strong 3-year CAGR and a mean reversion signal indicating an oversold condition, Health Care is a strong candidate for a Long position.\n\nThese pairs were selected based on the principles of momentum, mean reversion, and volatility, which are the core components of the Stage 1 analysis."
