The Long candidates are Energy, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Financials, while the Short candidates are Materials, Real Estate, Utilities, Information Technology, and Communication Services.\n\nThe top 5 Long candidates have strong 12-month returns, with Energy having the highest return at 0.1029. These sectors have also shown consistent trends over the past year, with trend strengths ranging from 0.4925 to 0.8097. The top 5 Short candidates have weak 12-month returns, with Materials having the lowest return at -0.0679. These sectors have also shown inconsistent trends over the past year, with trend strengths ranging from 0.3006 to 0.8606.\n\n(No additional reasoning for Stage 2 and Stage 3 as no accounting and macro data were provided.)"
