[Instruction]
Based on the [Monthly Analysis Context] and the corresponding [Monthly Sector Indicator Data] provided below, conduct a relative comparison of all 11 sectors.

Your analysis must be based solely on the provided "[Monthly Sector Indicator Data]" JSON.

Then, derive the Top 5 relative Views (Outperform or Underperform) with the clearest and most confident signals for the [Target View Month].

[Core Analytical Principles]
Use these definitions and relationships:

1) Indicators
- "3-year CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)" → structural growth anchor
- "Recent 12-month monthly returns (or Trailing 12-month (TTM) monthly returns)" → momentum path/rhythm (12 numbers)
- "Mean reversion signal (12-month z-score)" → overbought/oversold
- "12-month trend strength" → trend quality/consistency (0~1)
- "12-month volatility (or Trailing 12-month volatility)" → risk/instability

2) Correlations (qualitative checks)
- Momentum vs Trend strength: strong +
- CAGR vs recent returns: medium +
- |Z-score| vs Volatility: strong +
- Volatility vs Trend strength: strong -
- Momentum vs Z-score: strong - (overheating risk)

[Compute First, Then Judge]

A. PREP & PARSING
For each sector object in the JSON array:
- Read:
  - sector (string)
  - "3-year CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)" → float
  - "Recent 12-month monthly returns (or Trailing 12-month (TTM) monthly returns)" → list of 12 floats
  - "Mean reversion signal (12-month z-score)" → float
  - "12-month volatility (or Trailing 12-month volatility)" → float
  - "12-month trend strength" → float in [0,1]
- If numbers are strings, parse them as numbers.
- If the 12-month returns field is a string that looks like a list, parse it as a list.
- If the list does not contain exactly 12 numeric elements, exclude the sector from scoring and note the exclusion reason.

B. FEATURE CONSTRUCTION
- TTM_Return_Avg = mean of the 12 monthly returns.
- Keep:
  - CAGR_3Y = "3-year CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)"
  - Trend_12M = "12-month trend strength"
  - Z_12M = "Mean reversion signal (12-month z-score)"
  - Vol_12M = "12-month volatility (or Trailing 12-month volatility)"

C. NORMALIZATION (cross-sectional within the 11 sectors)
Use min–max normalization to [0,1] for each feature across all valid sectors:
- norm(x) = (x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin), with the following:
  - For CAGR_3Y → norm_cagr
  - For TTM_Return_Avg → norm_ttm
  - For Trend_12M → norm_trend
  - For Vol_12M → norm_vol
  - For Z_12M (signed) → compute max_abs_z = max(|Z_12M|) across sectors; z_signed = Z_12M / max_abs_z in [-1,1]

D. VIEW SCORE MODEL (must be applied exactly)
- Growth axis (reward):
  GrowthScore = 0.40 * norm_cagr
              + 0.30 * norm_ttm
              + 0.30 * norm_trend

- Risk/Reversal axis (penalty):
  - Overheating penalty (positive z only): OverheatPenalty = 0.15 * max(0, z_signed)
  - Volatility penalty: VolPenalty = 0.15 * norm_vol
  RiskPenalty = OverheatPenalty + VolPenalty

- Final View Score:
  ViewScore = GrowthScore - RiskPenalty

Notes:
- This makes negative z (oversold) implicitly favorable by avoiding OverheatPenalty.
- If max_abs_z = 0, set z_signed = 0 for all sectors (no overheat penalty).
- If (xmax - xmin) == 0 in any normalization, set norm = 0.5 for that feature for all sectors.

E. LABELING
- If ViewScore > 0 → "Outperform"
- If ViewScore < 0 → "Underperform"
- If exactly 0 → decide by lower "12-month volatility" gets the edge; if still tied, choose "Outperform".

F. RANKING & SELECTION
- Rank all valid sectors by ViewScore (descending).
- Select TOP 5 with the largest absolute edge and the clearest axis alignment:
  - Prefer sectors with high GrowthScore and low RiskPenalty for Outperform.
  - Prefer sectors with weak GrowthScore and high RiskPenalty for Underperform.
  - If a sector’s Vol_12M is the top decile among the 11, mention reduced confidence in its rationale.

[Output Format]
Acknowledge the dates and present ONLY the Top 5:

- As-Of: <ANALYSIS_DATE> | Target: <TARGET_MONTH>

1 <SECTOR NAME> — Outperform (View Score: +0.75)
   - Growth Axis: {brief: e.g., strong CAGR & TTM, firm trend}
   - Risk Axis: {brief: e.g., low vol, muted z-score}
   - Why this is confident: {1 sentence tying the two axes}

2 <SECTOR NAME> — Underperform (View Score: -0.62)
   - Growth Axis: {brief}
   - Risk Axis: {brief}
   - Why this is confident: {1 sentence}

3 <... up to 5 items total ...>

If any sectors were excluded due to invalid data (e.g., malformed 12M returns), list them after the Top 5 under “Exclusions” with a one-line reason each.

[Hard Constraints]
- Use ONLY the JSON above. No external data, no generic market commentary.
- The reported “View Score” MUST be the calculated score from the model herein.
- Round printed View Scores to two decimals (sign included, e.g., +0.73 / -0.48).
- Keep each rationale compact and axis-based.
