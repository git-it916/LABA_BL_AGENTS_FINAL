[Instruction]
Based on the `[Monthly Analysis Context]` specified below and the corresponding `[Monthly Sector Indicator Data]` provided, conduct a relative comparison of all 11 sectors.

Your analysis must be based **solely on the provided `[Monthly Sector Indicator Data]` (JSON)**.

Based on this analysis, derive the **Top 5 relative Views (Outperform or Underperform) with the clearest and most confident signals** for the **`[Target View Month]`**.

[Core Analytical Principles: Indicator Definitions & Correlations]
You must use the following definitions and theoretical relationships as a core basis for your judgment:

**1. Indicator Definitions (The Ingredients)**
* `3-year CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)`: The sector's long-term **structural growth** (the anchor).
* `Recent 12-month monthly returns (or Trailing 12-month (TTM) monthly returns)`: The path and **rhythm** of short-term momentum.
* `Mean reversion signal (12-month z-score)`: The level of short-term **overheating** (overbought) or **oversold** conditions.
* `12-month trend strength`: The **quality and consistency** of momentum (e.g., ratio of up-months).
* `12-month volatility (or Trailing 12-month volatility)`: The level of risk and signal **stability**.

**2. Key Indicator Correlations (The Physics)**
* **📈 The Growth/Direction Axis (Positive (+) Correlations)**
    * `Recent 12-month monthly returns (or Trailing 12-month (TTM) monthly returns)` ↔ `12-month trend strength (Strong +)`: The 'quantity' and 'quality' of momentum tend to move together.
    * `3-year CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)` ↔ `Recent 12-month monthly returns (or Trailing 12-month (TTM) monthly returns) (Medium +)`: Structural growth has an inertia effect that can bleed into short-term momentum.
* **📉 The Risk/Reversal Axis (Positive (+) Correlations)**
    * `Mean reversion signal (12-month z-score)` ↔ `12-month volatility (or Trailing 12-month volatility) (Strong +)`: Extreme overbought/oversold zones (high absolute Z-Score) are high-uncertainty, high-risk (high Volatility) zones.
* **⚖️ The Trade-Off Between Axes (Negative (-) Correlations)**
    * `Recent 12-month monthly returns (or Trailing 12-month (TTM) monthly returns)` ↔ `Mean reversion signal (12-month z-score) (Strong -)`: **(Momentum vs. Overheating)**. As momentum gets stronger, the probability of a mean-reversion (reversal) also rises.
    * `12-month volatility (or Trailing 12-month volatility)` ↔ `12-month trend strength (Strong -)`: **(Stability vs. Risk)**. High volatility implies low trend consistency.

[Reasoning Guideline]
Do not rely on rigid scenarios. Instead, contextually interpret the 'power dynamic' of the two axes to identify the clearest signals, following these principles:

* **1. Interpret the Axis Power Dynamic (The Core Logic)**
    * Your task is to compare the strength of the `Growth/Direction Axis` against the strength of the `Risk/Reversal Axis` for each sector.
    * View confidence is determined by **how clear and one-sided the signals from these two axes are**.

* **2. What a "Confident" Signal Looks Like**
    * **"Strongest Positive View (Outperform)" Candidate:**
        * The `Growth Axis` (CAGR, 12M Returns, Trend Strength) is **universally strong**, AND
        * The `Risk Axis` (Z-score, Volatility) is **low**, presenting no significant headwind to this growth.
    * **"Strongest Negative View (Underperform)" Candidate:**
        * The `Growth Axis` (CAGR, 12M) is **clearly collapsing**, while the `Risk Axis` (Volatility) is high, amplifying risk.
        * *OR* The `Growth Axis` (CAGR) is in decline, but the `Risk Axis` (Z-score) is showing an **explosive short-term overheating**, indicating a 'dangerous, overheated rally'.
    * **"Tactical Positive View (Tactical Outperform)" Candidate:**
        * The `Growth Axis` (CAGR) is **solid**, but the `Risk Axis` (Z-score) is signaling a **temporary, deep oversold** condition (e.g., < -2.0$\sigma$), indicating a high potential for a rebound.

* **3. Risk-Adjustment**
    * If `12-month volatility (or Trailing 12-month volatility)` is abnormally high, consider lowering confidence and excluding the sector from the Top 5, even if other signals are positive.
    * If `12-month volatility (or Trailing 12-month volatility)` is low, it increases the confidence in the current trend (whether that trend is positive or negative).

[Output Format]
1. Internally analyze all 11 sectors, but select **only the Top 5 sectors with the most confident and clear-cut signals**.
2. For these 5 sectors, provide an **'Outperform' or 'Underperform'** label and a **specific View value (e.g., +2.5%, -1.8%)**.
3. Provide a **core rationale** for each View, based on the `[Core Analytical Principles]` and explained through the **"Growth Axis vs. Risk Axis"** perspective.
