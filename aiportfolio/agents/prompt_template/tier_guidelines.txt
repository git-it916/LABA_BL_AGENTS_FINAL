### TIER 1 GUIDELINES (Technical Indicators Only)

**Available Data**:
- 3-year CAGR: Long-term structural growth trend (higher = better)
- Recent 12-month returns: Short-term momentum (higher = better)
- 12-month trend strength (R²): Trend consistency (closer to 1.0 = better)
- 12-month volatility: Risk/instability (lower = better)
- Mean reversion signal (z-score): Overbought/oversold indicator
  - z > 1.5: Overbought (potential pullback → Short signal)
  - z < -1.5: Oversold (potential bounce → Long signal)

**Selection Strategy**:
1. **Long Candidates**: Sectors with strong momentum cluster:
   - High 3-year CAGR (structural tailwind)
   - High 12-month avg returns (current momentum)
   - High trend strength R² (quality trend)
   - Bonus: Low volatility OR negative z-score (not overbought)

2. **Short Candidates**: Sectors with weak momentum cluster:
   - Low/negative 3-year CAGR
   - Low/negative 12-month avg returns
   - Bonus: High volatility OR z-score > 1.5 (overbought)

**Confidence Calibration**:
- Strong conviction (relative_return_view ≥ 0.03): All 3 core signals align + bonus factors
- Moderate conviction (0.01-0.03): 2 of 3 core signals align
- Low conviction (< 0.01): Only 1 signal, use as tiebreaker

### TIER 2 GUIDELINES (Technical + Accounting Indicators)

**Additional Data**:
- P/E (Price-to-Earnings): Valuation (lower = cheaper)
- ROE (Return on Equity): Profitability quality (higher = better)
- P/B (Price-to-Book): Book value multiple (lower = cheaper)
- Debt-to-Equity: Financial leverage (context-dependent)
- Operating Margin: Operational efficiency (higher = better)

**Enhanced Strategy** (builds on Tier 1):
1. **Upgrade Long Confidence**: Tier 1 Long + Low P/E + High ROE
   - Interpretation: Strong momentum with cheap valuation = "Quality at a discount"
   - Action: Increase relative_return_view by 0.01-0.02

2. **Downgrade Long Confidence**: Tier 1 Long + High P/E + Low ROE
   - Interpretation: Momentum driven by speculation, not fundamentals
   - Action: Reduce confidence or remove view

3. **Upgrade Short Confidence**: Tier 1 Short + High P/E + Low ROE
   - Interpretation: Weak momentum + expensive valuation = "Priced for perfection it can't deliver"
   - Action: Increase relative_return_view magnitude

4. **Challenge Views**: If accounting contradicts momentum, investigate:
   - Strong momentum + deteriorating ROE trend → Reduce Long
   - Weak momentum + improving margins → Reconsider Short

**Key Principle**: Momentum + Valuation alignment creates highest conviction

### TIER 3 GUIDELINES (Full Integration: Technical + Accounting + Macro)

**Additional Data** (when available):
- Interest rate trend (Rising/Falling/Stable)
- Inflation trend (Rising/Falling/Stable)
- GDP growth trend
- Credit spread trends
- Sector-specific macro drivers

**Macro Overlay Strategy** (final filter on Tier 2 views):
1. **Macro Tailwinds** (strengthen conviction):
   - Rising rates + Long Financials → Banks benefit from higher NIM
   - Rising inflation + Long Energy/Materials → Pricing power
   - Falling rates + Long Real Estate/Utilities → Lower cost of capital
   - Strong GDP + Long Industrials/Discretionary → Economic sensitivity

2. **Macro Headwinds** (weaken or flip views):
   - Rising rates + Long Real Estate → REMOVE or flip to Short
   - Rising inflation + Long Consumer Staples → Margin compression
   - Recession risk + Long Discretionary → Reduce exposure

3. **Macro Veto Power**:
   - If macro environment directly contradicts Tier 2 view, macro wins
   - Example: Strong Energy momentum + Low oil price forecast → Downgrade Long Energy

**Final Calibration**:
- Review all 5 pairs for macro consistency
- Ensure portfolio makes sense in current regime
- Adjust relative_return_view to reflect macro amplification (+0.005 to +0.015)

### COMMON RULES (All Tiers)

**View Construction**:
- Exactly 5 pairs, no duplicates
- Each sector can appear max 2 times across all pairs
- relative_return_view range: -0.05 to +0.05 (realistic)
- Rank pairs by conviction (highest first)

**Quality Checks**:
- Avoid contradiction (same sector both Long and Short)
- Ensure views are actionable (not too small, not too large)
- Consider sector correlations (avoid redundant pairs like Energy Long + Materials Long vs same Short)
