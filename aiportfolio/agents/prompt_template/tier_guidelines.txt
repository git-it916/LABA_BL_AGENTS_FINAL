### TIER 1 GUIDELINES (Technical Indicators Only)

**Available Data**:
- 3-year CAGR: Long-term structural growth trend (higher = better)
- Recent 12-month returns: Short-term momentum (higher = better)
- 12-month trend strength (R²): Trend consistency (closer to 1.0 = better)
- 12-month volatility: Risk/instability (lower = better)
- Mean reversion signal (z-score): Overbought/oversold indicator
  - z > 1.5: Overbought (potential pullback → Short signal)
  - z < -1.5: Oversold (potential bounce → Long signal)

**Selection Strategy**:
1. **Long Candidates**: Sectors with strong momentum cluster:
   - High 3-year CAGR (structural tailwind)
   - High 12-month avg returns (current momentum)
   - High trend strength R² (quality trend)
   - Bonus: Low volatility OR negative z-score (not overbought)

2. **Short Candidates**: Sectors with weak momentum cluster:
   - Low/negative 3-year CAGR
   - Low/negative 12-month avg returns
   - Bonus: High volatility OR z-score > 1.5 (overbought)

**Confidence Calibration**:
- Strong conviction (relative_return_view ≥ 0.03): All 3 core signals align + bonus factors
- Moderate conviction (0.01-0.03): 2 of 3 core signals align
- Low conviction (< 0.01): Only 1 signal, use as tiebreaker

### TIER 2 GUIDELINES (Technical + Accounting Indicators)

Available Data (from Accounting layer):
- Book/Market (bm): Valuation (Higher = cheaper; indicates value orientation)
- Shiller CAPE (capei): Valuation (Lower = cheaper; high CAPE → potentially overvalued sector)
- Gross Profit / Total Assets (gprof): Efficiency (Higher = assets generate profit efficiently)
- Net Profit Margin (npm): Profitability (Higher = better cost control and pricing power)
- Return on Assets (ROA): Profitability (Higher = stronger overall asset utilization)
- Return on Equity (ROE): Profitability / Quality (Higher = stronger shareholder return efficiency)
- Total Debt / Invested Capital (totdebt_invcap): Leverage (Higher = more financial risk; context-dependent)
- Enhanced Strategy (Building on Tier 1 Momentum Framework)

Selection Strategy:
Enhanced Selection Criteria (Accounting-Informed Momentum Framework)

1. Valuation Alignment (Book/Market, Shiller CAPE)
- High Book/Market → undervalued; Low CAPE → attractive entry point.
- When momentum aligns with value (bm↑ or CAPE↓), reinforce Long conviction (+0.01~+0.03).
- When momentum diverges (bm↓ and CAPE↑), reduce Long bias or consider Short if profitability also weakens.

2. Profitability Alignment (gprof, npm, ROA, ROE)
- High gprof = efficient asset use; npm = pricing power; ROA/ROE = profitability quality.
- Improving profitability (↑) supports continuation of momentum; declining profitability (↓) suggests reversal risk.
- Profitability changes confirm or challenge technical trends.

3. Leverage Context (Total Debt / Invested Capital)
- High leverage with strong profitability = effective capital use.
- High leverage with falling margins = fragility; increases short bias.
- Low leverage = stability; enhances resilience under volatility.

4. Integrated Momentum View: Combine accounting with momentum (CAGR, trend R², z-score, volatility).
- Momentum↑ + Value↑ + Profitability↑ → Strong Long
- Momentum↓ + Value↓ + Profitability↓ → Strong Short
- Momentum↑ + Profitability↓ → reduce conviction
- Momentum↓ + Profitability↑ → watch for rebound

### TIER 3 GUIDELINES (Full Integration: Technical + Accounting + Macro)

**Additional Data** (when available):
- Interest rate trend (Rising/Falling/Stable)
- Inflation trend (Rising/Falling/Stable)
- GDP growth trend
- Credit spread trends
- Sector-specific macro drivers

**Macro Overlay Strategy** (final filter on Tier 2 views):
1. **Macro Tailwinds** (strengthen conviction):
   - Rising rates + Long Financials → Banks benefit from higher NIM
   - Rising inflation + Long Energy/Materials → Pricing power
   - Falling rates + Long Real Estate/Utilities → Lower cost of capital
   - Strong GDP + Long Industrials/Discretionary → Economic sensitivity

2. **Macro Headwinds** (weaken or flip views):
   - Rising rates + Long Real Estate → REMOVE or flip to Short
   - Rising inflation + Long Consumer Staples → Margin compression
   - Recession risk + Long Discretionary → Reduce exposure

3. **Macro Veto Power**:
   - If macro environment directly contradicts Tier 2 view, macro wins
   - Example: Strong Energy momentum + Low oil price forecast → Downgrade Long Energy

**Final Calibration**:
- Review all 5 pairs for macro consistency
- Ensure portfolio makes sense in current regime
- Adjust relative_return_view to reflect macro amplification (+0.005 to +0.015)

### COMMON RULES (All Tiers)

**View Construction**:
- Exactly 5 pairs, no duplicates
- Each sector can appear max 2 times across all pairs
- relative_return_view range: -0.05 to +0.05 (realistic)
- Rank pairs by conviction (highest first)

**Quality Checks**:
- Avoid contradiction (same sector both Long and Short)
- Ensure views are actionable (not too small, not too large)
- Consider sector correlations (avoid redundant pairs like Energy Long + Materials Long vs same Short)
