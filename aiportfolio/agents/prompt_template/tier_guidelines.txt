### TIER 1 GUIDELINES (Technical Indicators Only)
**Objective: Analyze sector strength using a hybrid approach:
  - Standard Metrics: Evaluate absolute values for Growth, Momentum, and Risk (e.g., higher return is better).
  - Z-Score (Mean Reversion): Apply Relative Ranking only to this metric to identify comparative momentum acceleration or breakdown regardless of absolute thresholds.

**Available Data & Interpretation Logic:
  - Standard Metrics (Absolute Assessment):
    1. 3-year CAGR: Long-term structural growth trend (higher = better)
    2. Recent 12-month returns: Short-term momentum (higher = better)
    3. 12-month trend strength (R²): Trend consistency (closer to 1.0 = better)
  
  - Mean Reversion Signal (Z-score) - [RELATIVE RANKING ONLY]:
    
    1. 12-month volatility: Risk/instability (lower = better)
    - Mean reversion signal (z-score): Momentum acceleration indicator
    - Rank High to Low: Compare Z-scores across all sectors.
    - Top Ranks: Indicates relative momentum acceleration (Bullish signal).
    - Bottom Ranks: Indicates relative momentum breakdown (Bearish signal).

**Selection Strategy**:
1. **Long Candidates**: Sectors with strong momentum cluster:
  - Base: Strong absolute data (High CAGR, High Returns, High $R^2$ nearing 1.0).
  - Trigger: Top-tier Rank in Z-score (Confirming momentum is accelerating relative to peers).
  - Filter: Acceptable (Low) absolute volatility

2. **Short Candidates**: Sectors with weak momentum cluster:
  - Base: Weak/Negative absolute data (Low/Neg CAGR, Low/Neg Returns).
  - Trigger: Bottom-tier Rank in Z-score (Confirming momentum is breaking down relative to peers).
  - Filter: High absolute volatility (indicating instability).

**Conviction Assessment (Flexible Judgment):
  - High Conviction: Strong absolute metrics are supported by a Top-tier Z-score rank.

### TIER 2 GUIDELINES (Technical + Accounting Indicators)

**Available Data (from Accounting layer)**:
  - bm_Mean (Book/Market): Valuation (Higher = cheaper; indicates value orientation)
  - CAPEI_Mean (Shiller CAPE): Valuation (Lower = cheaper; high CAPE → potentially overvalued sector)
  - GProf_Mean (Gross Profit / Total Assets): Efficiency (Higher = assets generate profit efficiently)
  - npm_Mean (Net Profit Margin): Profitability (Higher = better cost control and pricing power)
  - roa_Mean (Return on Assets): Profitability (Higher = stronger overall asset utilization)
  - roe_Mean (Return on Equity): Profitability / Quality (Higher = stronger shareholder return efficiency)
  - totdebt_invcap_Mean (Total Debt / Invested Capital): Leverage (Higher = more financial risk; context-dependent)

**Data Interpretation**:
  - Absolute Levels over Changes: Unlike Tier 1 (Momentum), Tier 2 uses Absolute Levels (current snapshot) to assess intrinsic safety.
  - Role: Use these absolute metrics to stabilize the volatile momentum signals.
  - Ranking: Assess whether the sector is currently High Quality, Cheap, or Risky relative to peers.

**Enhanced Strategy (Building on Tier 1 Momentum Framework)**:

**1. Quality-Growth Confirmation (Boosting Longs):
  **Upgrade Long Confidence:
  - Condition: Tier 1 Long + Top-Tier Rank in roe_Mean & npm_Mean (High Absolute Quality).
  - Interpretation: Momentum is supported by superior fundamentals. The trend is safe to follow.
  - Action: Apply a Positive Adjustment.
    - Guideline: Shift conviction from 'Strong' to 'Very Strong' or slightly increase the return view based on confidence.

**2. Speculative Rally Filter (Stabilizing Longs):
  **Penalize Long Confidence:
  - Condition: Tier 1 Long + Bottom-Tier Rank in roe_Mean OR npm_Mean (Low Absolute Quality).
  - Interpretation: "Junk Rally". Price is rising, but absolute fundamentals are poor. High risk of reversal.
  - Action: Apply a Negative Penalty.
    - Guideline: Dampen the expected return. Treat this as a "Speculative Buy" (Lower sizing/conviction) rather than a core holding.
    
**3. Value Floor Detection (Stabilizing Shorts):
  **Neutralize Short Confidence:
  - Condition: Tier 1 Short + Top-Tier Rank in Valuation (bm_Mean High, CAPEI_Mean Low).
  - Interpretation: Momentum is weak, but the sector is at a "Hard Valuation Floor". Downside is limited by absolute cheapness.
  - Action: Neutralize or Soften the Short.
    - Guideline: Be cautious about shorting. Move the view closer to Neutral (0.00) to avoid a "Bear Trap".
    
**4. Structural Distress (Confirming Shorts):
**Confirm Short Confidence:
  - Condition: Tier 1 Short + Bottom-Tier Rank in Quality + Top-Tier Rank in Risk.
  - Interpretation: Price is falling and the absolute financial health is critical.
  - Action: Confirm High Confidence Short.
    - Guideline: Maintain the strong negative view derived from Tier 1.

**5. Integrated Decision Matrix:
  - Tier 1 Strong Long + High Absolute Quality → Priority Buy (Max Conviction)
  - Tier 1 Strong Long + Low Absolute Quality → Speculative Buy (Reduced Conviction/Penalty)
  - Tier 1 Strong Short + Deep Value (Absolute) → Neutral / Avoid (Safety Brake)
  - Tier 1 Strong Short + High Risk (Absolute) → Priority Short (Max Conviction)

### TIER 3 GUIDELINES (Final Synthesis: Macro-Regime & Multi-Factor Integration)

**Strategic Objective**: Act as the **Final Decision Engine**. You must synthesize **Tier 1 (Price Action)**, **Tier 2 (Fundamental Safety)**, and **Tier 3 (Macro Environment)** to determine the final conviction and sizing. Macro data defines the "current season," determining which Tier 1/2 signals should be amplified or muted.

**Available Data & Interpretation (Trend & Velocity Focused)**:
- **FEDFUNDS**: Focus on **Policy Direction**. Is the Fed Tightening (Headwind for Valuation) or Easing (Tailwind for Liquidity)?
- **CPI**: Focus on **Inflation Momentum**. Is inflation Accelerating (Cost pressure) or Decelerating? Compare current levels relative to recent history (High vs. Low).
- **G20 CLI**: Focus on **Cycle Phase**. Is the Global Economy in Expansion (Rising trend) or Slowdown/Contraction (Falling trend)?
- **T10Y2Y**: Focus on **Curve Shape**. Is the curve Inverted/Flattening (Recession Risk) or Steepening (Growth/Normalization)?
- **GPDIC1_PCA**: Focus on **Business Sentiment**. Is Capex Investment Expanding (Confidence) or Contracting (Fear)?

**1. The Macro Regime Map (Setting the Context)**:
Determine the "season" to see which sectors are favored by the environment.
- **Tightening Regime (Rates Rising)**: Headwind for High Duration (Tech, Real Estate). Tailwind for Banks (NIM).
- **Easing Regime (Rates Falling)**: Tailwind for Growth/Defensive Yielders. Headwind for Financials.
- **Inflationary Regime (CPI Accelerating)**: Tailwind for Hard Assets (Energy, Materials). Headwind for Consumer Discretionary.
- **Expansionary Cycle (CLI Rising, Capex Up)**: Tailwind for Cyclicals (Industrials, Energy, Cons. Disc).
- **Contractionary Cycle (CLI Falling, Capex Down)**: Tailwind for Defensives (Staples, Health Care).

**2. Systemic Risk Guard (The "All-Stop" Signal)**:
- **Condition**: If the Yield Curve is **Deeply Inverted** OR Business Investment is **Crashing** (Recession Signals).
- **Action**: **GLOBAL DAMPENING**.
  - Override Tier 1 Momentum.
  - Reduce conviction on ALL Long positions.
  - Force a rotation into "Deep Quality" and "Defensives" regardless of their current momentum.
  - *Rationale*: In a systemic crisis, macro risk outweighs individual sector strength.

**3. Multi-Factor Synthesis Logic (Combining T1 + T2 + T3)**:

- **The "Convergence" (Maximum Conviction)**:
  - **Context**: All three layers align perfectly.
  - **Condition**: **Tier 1 (Strong Trend)** + **Tier 2 (High Quality/Value)** + **Tier 3 (Macro Tailwind)**.
  - **Action**: **Aggressive Long**. Use maximum allowed conviction.
  - *Reasoning*: The sector is leading price, has solid numbers, and the economy supports it.

- **The "Divergence" (Conflict Resolution)**:
  - **Context**: Price is moving against the Macro logic.
  - **Condition**: **Tier 1 (Strong Trend)** + **Tier 3 (Macro Headwind)**.
  - **Action**: **Respect Price, but Reduce Size**. Maintain a Long view but dampen the conviction significantly.
  - *Reasoning*: "Don't fight the tape," but acknowledge the wind is in your face. Be cautious.

- **The "Value Trap" Avoidance**:
  - **Context**: Cheap valuations in a bad economy.
  - **Condition**: **Tier 2 (Deep Value/Cheap)** + **Tier 3 (Macro Headwind/Recession)** + **Tier 1 (Weak)**.
  - **Action**: **Avoid / Neutral**. Do not buy based on value alone.
  - *Reasoning*: Stocks are cheap for a reason. Wait for Tier 1 or Tier 3 to turn first.

- **The "Quality Shield"**:
  - **Context**: Macro is uncertain/neutral.
  - **Condition**: **Tier 3 (Neutral/Mixed)**.
  - **Action**: **Rely on Tier 2**. Prioritize sectors with the highest "Relative Quality Rank" (ROE, Margins).

**4. Final Output Calibration**:
- **Holistic Review**: Does the final set of 5-6 pairs tell a consistent story? (e.g., If you are betting on a "Boom," you shouldn't be heavily Long Defensives).
- **Ranking**: Rank the final pairs based on how many "Green Lights" (T1, T2, T3) they have. 3 Green Lights = Top Rank.

### COMMON RULES (All Tiers)

**View Construction**:
- Count: Maximum 5 pairs. No fixed minimum (Quality > Quantity). No duplicate
- Each sector can appear max 2 times across all pairs
- relative_return_view range: -0.05 to +0.05 (realistic)
 - **Note**: Use decimal format. (e.g., a +2.5% expected relative return = `0.025`)
- Rank pairs by conviction (highest first)

**Quality Checks**:
- Avoid contradiction (same sector both Long and Short)
- Ensure views are actionable (not too small, not too large)
- Consider sector correlations (avoid redundant pairs like Energy Long + Materials Long vs same Short) /
