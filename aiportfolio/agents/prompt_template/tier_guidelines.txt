### TIER 1 GUIDELINES (Technical Indicators Only)

**Available Data**:
- 3-year CAGR: Long-term structural growth trend (higher = better)
- Recent 12-month returns: Short-term momentum (higher = better)
- 12-month trend strength (R²): Trend consistency (closer to 1.0 = better)
- 12-month volatility: Risk/instability (lower = better)
- Mean reversion signal (z-score): Overbought/oversold indicator
  - z > 1.5: Overbought (potential pullback → Short signal)
  - z < -1.5: Oversold (potential bounce → Long signal)

**Selection Strategy**:
1. **Long Candidates**: Sectors with strong momentum cluster:
   - High 3-year CAGR (structural tailwind)
   - High 12-month avg returns (current momentum)
   - High trend strength R² (quality trend)
   - Bonus: Low volatility OR negative z-score (not overbought)

2. **Short Candidates**: Sectors with weak momentum cluster:
   - Low/negative 3-year CAGR
   - Low/negative 12-month avg returns
   - Bonus: High volatility OR z-score > 1.5 (overbought)

**Confidence Calibration**:
- Strong conviction (relative_return_view ≥ 0.03): All 3 core signals align + bonus factors
- Moderate conviction (0.01-0.03): 2 of 3 core signals align
- Low conviction (< 0.01): Only 1 signal, use as tiebreaker

### TIER 2 GUIDELINES (Technical + Accounting Indicators)

Available Data (from Accounting layer):
- Book/Market (bm): Valuation (Higher = cheaper; indicates value orientation)
- Shiller CAPE (capei): Valuation (Lower = cheaper; high CAPE → potentially overvalued sector)
- Gross Profit / Total Assets (gprof): Efficiency (Higher = assets generate profit efficiently)
- Net Profit Margin (npm): Profitability (Higher = better cost control and pricing power)
- Return on Assets (ROA): Profitability (Higher = stronger overall asset utilization)
- Return on Equity (ROE): Profitability / Quality (Higher = stronger shareholder return efficiency)
- Total Debt / Invested Capital (totdebt_invcap): Leverage (Higher = more financial risk; context-dependent)
- Enhanced Strategy (Building on Tier 1 Momentum Framework)

Upgrade Long Confidence:
Condition: Tier 1 Long + High bm + High ROE + Low CAPE
Interpretation: Momentum aligns with “value at a discount” — quality growth at attractive price.
Action: Increase relative_return_view by +0.01 ~ +0.02.
- **Note**: Use decimal format. (e.g., a +2.5% expected relative return = `0.025`)
Downgrade Long Confidence:
Condition: Tier 1 Long + Low bm + Low ROE + High CAPE
Interpretation: Momentum likely speculative; weak fundamentals behind price trend.
Action: Reduce relative_return_view by 0.01 or set confidence = neutral.

Upgrade Short Confidence:
Condition: Tier 1 Short + High CAPE + Low ROE + High Debt/Capital
Interpretation: Weak momentum with expensive valuation and rising leverage → fragile fundamentals.
Action: Increase short conviction (magnitude of relative_return_view).

<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Profitability Alignment (gprof, npm, ROA, ROE)
- High gprof = efficient asset use; npm = pricing power; ROA/ROE = profitability quality.
- Improving profitability (↑) supports continuation of momentum; declining profitability (↓) suggests reversal risk.
- Profitability changes confirm or challenge technical trends.

3. Leverage Context (Total Debt / Invested Capital)
- High leverage with strong profitability = effective capital use.
- High leverage with falling margins = fragility; increases short bias.
- Low leverage = stability; enhances resilience under volatility.

4. Integrated Momentum View: Combine accounting with momentum (CAGR, trend R², z-score, volatility)
- Momentum↑ + Value↑ + Profitability↑ → Strong Long
- Momentum↓ + Value↓ + Profitability↓ → Strong Short
- Momentum↑ + Profitability↓ → reduce conviction
- Momentum↓ + Profitability↑ → watch for rebound
=======
Challenge or Rebalance Views:
Case A: Momentum uptrend but ROE/ROA deteriorating → reduce Long exposure.
Case B: Momentum downtrend but Margins (npm, gprof) improving → reconsider or reduce Short exposure.
Case C: High leverage (totdebt_invcap ↑) with stable profitability → assess risk-adjusted return; avoid extremes.

### TIER 3 GUIDELINES (Full Integration: Technical + Accounting + Macro)

**Additional Data** (when available):
- Interest rate trend (Rising/Falling/Stable)
- Inflation trend (Rising/Falling/Stable)
- GDP growth trend
- Credit spread trends
- Sector-specific macro drivers

**Macro Overlay Strategy** (final filter on Tier 2 views):
1. **Macro Tailwinds** (strengthen conviction):
   - Rising rates + Long Financials → Banks benefit from higher NIM
   - Rising inflation + Long Energy/Materials → Pricing power
   - Falling rates + Long Real Estate/Utilities → Lower cost of capital
   - Strong GDP + Long Industrials/Discretionary → Economic sensitivity

2. **Macro Headwinds** (weaken or flip views):
   - Rising rates + Long Real Estate → REMOVE or flip to Short
   - Rising inflation + Long Consumer Staples → Margin compression
   - Recession risk + Long Discretionary → Reduce exposure

3. **Macro Veto Power**:
   - If macro environment directly contradicts Tier 2 view, macro wins
   - Example: Strong Energy momentum + Low oil price forecast → Downgrade Long Energy

4. Macro-Integrated View: Combine returns, accounting, and macro indicators.
   - Momentum↑ + Value↑ + Profitability↑ + Macro↑ → Strong Long
   - Momentum↓ + Value↓ + Profitability↓ + Macro↓ → Strong Short
   - Momentum↑ + Profitability↑ + Macro↓ → Cyclical Overheat / Reduce Long Exposure
   - Momentum↓ + Profitability↓ + Macro↑ → Early Recovery / Watch for Rebound
   - Value↑ + Macro↑ + Momentum↓ → Contrarian Long

**Final Calibration**:
- Review all 5 pairs for macro consistency
- Ensure portfolio makes sense in current regime
- Adjust relative_return_view to reflect macro amplification (+0.005 to +0.015)
- **Note**: Use decimal format. (e.g., a +2.5% expected relative return = `0.025`)
---

### COMMON RULES (All Tiers)

**View Construction**:
- Exactly 5 pairs, no duplicates
- Each sector can appear max 2 times across all pairs
- relative_return_view range: -0.05 to +0.05 (realistic)
 - **Note**: Use decimal format. (e.g., a +2.5% expected relative return = `0.025`)
- Rank pairs by conviction (highest first)

**Quality Checks**:
- Avoid contradiction (same sector both Long and Short)
- Ensure views are actionable (not too small, not too large)
- Consider sector correlations (avoid redundant pairs like Energy Long + Materials Long vs same Short)
