### TIER 1 GUIDELINES (Technical Indicators Only)

**Available Data**:
- 3-year CAGR: Long-term structural growth trend (higher = better)
- Recent 12-month returns: Short-term momentum (higher = better)
- 12-month trend strength (R²): Trend consistency (closer to 1.0 = better)
- 12-month volatility: Risk/instability (lower = better)
- Mean reversion signal (z-score): Momentum acceleration indicator
  - z > 1.5: Strong momentum acceleration → Increase Long conviction (momentum continuation)
  - z < -1.5: Momentum breakdown → Increase Short conviction (downtrend)
  - -1.5 < z < 1.5: Neutral momentum → Use other signals

### TIER 2 GUIDELINES (Technical + Accounting Indicators)

**Available Data (from Accounting layer)**:
- Book/Market (bm): Valuation (Higher = cheaper; indicates value orientation)
- Shiller CAPE (capei): Valuation (Lower = cheaper; high CAPE → potentially overvalued sector)
- Gross Profit / Total Assets (gprof): Efficiency (Higher = assets generate profit efficiently)
- Net Profit Margin (npm): Profitability (Higher = better cost control and pricing power)
- Return on Assets (ROA): Profitability (Higher = stronger overall asset utilization)
- Return on Equity (ROE): Profitability / Quality (Higher = stronger shareholder return efficiency)
- Total Debt / Invested Capital (totdebt_invcap): Leverage (Higher = more financial risk; context-dependent)

### TIER 3 GUIDELINES (Full Integration: Technical + Accounting + Macro)
**Additional Data (when available):
- Interest rate trend (Rising/Falling/Stable): Defines the cost of capital and discount rates for future cash flows. (e.g., Fed Funds Rate, 10Y Treasury)
- Inflation trend (Rising/Falling/Stable): Impacts real returns, corporate pricing power, and central bank policy. (e.g., CPI, PCE)
- GDP growth trend: Indicates the overall health and expansion/contraction phase of the economy. (e.g., Real GDP Growth, OECD CLI)
- Credit spread trends: Reflects market risk appetite and financial system stress; widening spreads signal risk-off. (e.g., High Yield Spread)

### COMMON RULES (All Tiers)

**View Construction**:
- Exactly 5 pairs, no duplicates
- Each sector can appear max 2 times across all pairs
- relative_return_view range: -0.05 to +0.05 (realistic)
 - **Note**: Use decimal format. (e.g., a +2.5% expected relative return = `0.025`)
- Rank pairs by conviction (highest first)

**Quality Checks**:
- Avoid contradiction (same sector both Long and Short)
- Ensure views are actionable (not too small, not too large)
- Consider sector correlations (avoid redundant pairs like Energy Long + Materials Long vs same Short)

**Confidence Calibration**:
- Strong conviction (relative_return_view ≥ 0.025): All 3 core signals align
- Moderate conviction (0.015-0.025): 2 of 3 core signals align
- Low conviction (0.01-0.015): 1 signal + bonus factors
- Very low conviction (< 0.01): Use as tiebreaker only

**Final Calibration**:
- Maximum relative_return_view: 0.05 (5%)
- Minimum for inclusion: 0.01 (1%)
- Ensure portfolio makes sense in current macro regime
- **Note**: Use decimal format. (e.g., a +2.5% expected relative return = `0.025`)
