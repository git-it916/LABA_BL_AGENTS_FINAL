### TIER 1 GUIDELINES (Technical Indicators Only)
**Objective: Analyze sector strength using a hybrid approach:
  - Standard Metrics: Evaluate absolute values for Growth, Momentum, and Risk (e.g., higher return is better).
  - Z-Score (Mean Reversion): Apply Relative Ranking only to this metric to identify comparative momentum acceleration or breakdown regardless of absolute thresholds.

**Available Data & Interpretation Logic:
  - Standard Metrics (Absolute Assessment):
    1. 3-year CAGR: Long-term structural growth trend (higher = better)
    2. Recent 12-month returns: Short-term momentum (higher = better)
    3. 12-month trend strength (R²): Trend consistency (closer to 1.0 = better)
  
  - Mean Reversion Signal (Z-score) - [RELATIVE RANKING ONLY]:
    
    1. 12-month volatility: Risk/instability (lower = better)
    - Mean reversion signal (z-score): Momentum acceleration indicator
    - Rank High to Low: Compare Z-scores across all sectors.
    - Top Ranks: Indicates relative momentum acceleration (Bullish signal).
    - Bottom Ranks: Indicates relative momentum breakdown (Bearish signal).

**Selection Strategy**:
1. **Long Candidates**: Sectors with strong momentum cluster:
  - Base: Strong absolute data (High CAGR, High Returns, High $R^2$ nearing 1.0).
  - Trigger: Top-tier Rank in Z-score (Confirming momentum is accelerating relative to peers).
  - Filter: Acceptable (Low) absolute volatility

2. **Short Candidates**: Sectors with weak momentum cluster:
  - Base: Weak/Negative absolute data (Low/Neg CAGR, Low/Neg Returns).
  - Trigger: Bottom-tier Rank in Z-score (Confirming momentum is breaking down relative to peers).
  - Filter: High absolute volatility (indicating instability).

**Conviction Assessment (Flexible Judgment):
  - High Conviction: Strong absolute metrics are supported by a Top-tier Z-score rank.

### TIER 2 GUIDELINES (Technical + Accounting Indicators)

**Available Data (from Accounting layer)**:
  - bm_Mean: Book/Market Ratio (Lower = Cheaper/Value)
  - CAPEI_Mean: Shiller CAPE Ratio (Lower = Cheaper)
  - GProf_Mean: Gross Profitability (Higher = More Efficient)
  - npm_Mean: Net Profit Margin (Higher = Better Profitability)
  - roa_Mean: Return on Assets (Higher = Better Asset Utilization)
  - roe_Mean: Return on Equity (Higher = Better Quality)
  - totdebt_invcap_Mean: Total Debt/Invested Capital (Lower = Less Leveraged/Safer)

**Enhanced Strategy (Building on Tier 1 Momentum Framework)**:

**1. Quality-Growth Confirmation (Boosting Longs):
  **Upgrade Long Confidence:
  - Condition: Tier 1 Long + High roe_Mean & npm_Mean (Strong Quality).
  - Interpretation: Momentum is supported by superior fundamentals. The trend is safe to follow.
  - Action: Apply a Positive Adjustment.
    - Guideline: Shift conviction from 'Strong' to 'Very Strong' or slightly increase the return view based on confidence.

**2. Speculative Rally Awareness (Monitoring Longs):
  **Minor Caution on Long Confidence:
  - Condition: Tier 1 Long + Low roe_Mean OR npm_Mean (Weak Quality).
  - Interpretation: Price momentum is strong but quality is low. Monitor for potential reversal.
  - Action: Apply a Small Caution (Optional minor adjustment -0.005 or less).
    - Guideline: Maintain the Tier 1 view but acknowledge quality concerns. Do NOT heavily dampen the return.

**3. Value Floor Awareness (Short Monitoring):
  **Minor Caution on Short Confidence:
  - Condition: Tier 1 Short + Low bm_Mean & CAPEI_Mean (Deep Value).
  - Interpretation: Momentum is weak, but valuation suggests potential value support.
  - Action: Apply Small Caution (Optional minor adjustment +0.005 to reduce short intensity).
    - Guideline: Maintain Tier 1 short view but acknowledge value floor. Do NOT fully neutralize.

**4. Structural Distress (Confirming Shorts):
**Confirm Short Confidence:
  - Condition: Tier 1 Short + Low Quality (roe, npm) + High Debt (totdebt_invcap).
  - Interpretation: Price is falling and the financial health is deteriorating.
  - Action: Confirm High Confidence Short.
    - Guideline: Maintain the strong negative view derived from Tier 1.

**5. Integrated Decision Matrix (Tier 1 Dominates, Tier 2 Refines):
  - Tier 1 Strong Long + High Quality → Priority Buy (Boost +0.005 to +0.01)
  - Tier 1 Strong Long + Low Quality → Maintain Long (Minor caution -0.005 max)
  - Tier 1 Strong Short + Deep Value → Maintain Short (Minor caution +0.005 max)
  - Tier 1 Strong Short + High Debt/Low Quality → Priority Short (Boost -0.005 to -0.01)

### TIER 3 GUIDELINES (Final Synthesis: Macro-Regime & Multi-Factor Integration)

**Strategic Objective**: Act as the **Final Decision Engine**. You must synthesize **Tier 1 (Price Action)**, **Tier 2 (Fundamental Safety)**, and **Tier 3 (Macro Environment)** to determine the final conviction and sizing. Macro data defines the "current season," determining which Tier 1/2 signals should be amplified or muted.

**Available Data & Interpretation (Trend & Velocity Focused)**:
- **FEDFUNDS**: Focus on **Policy Direction**. Is the Fed Tightening (Headwind for Valuation) or Easing (Tailwind for Liquidity)?
- **CPI**: Focus on **Inflation Momentum**. Is inflation Accelerating (Cost pressure) or Decelerating? Compare current levels relative to recent history (High vs. Low).
- **G20 CLI**: Focus on **Cycle Phase**. Is the Global Economy in Expansion (Rising trend) or Slowdown/Contraction (Falling trend)?
- **T10Y2Y**: Focus on **Curve Shape**. Is the curve Inverted/Flattening (Recession Risk) or Steepening (Growth/Normalization)?
- **GPDIC1_PCA**: Focus on **Business Sentiment**. Is Capex Investment Expanding (Confidence) or Contracting (Fear)?

**1. The Macro Regime Map (Setting the Context)**:
Determine the "season" to see which sectors are favored by the environment.
- **Tightening Regime (Rates Rising)**: Headwind for High Duration (Tech, Real Estate). Tailwind for Banks (NIM).
- **Easing Regime (Rates Falling)**: Tailwind for Growth/Defensive Yielders. Headwind for Financials.
- **Inflationary Regime (CPI Accelerating)**: Tailwind for Hard Assets (Energy, Materials). Headwind for Consumer Discretionary.
- **Expansionary Cycle (CLI Rising, Capex Up)**: Tailwind for Cyclicals (Industrials, Energy, Cons. Disc).
- **Contractionary Cycle (CLI Falling, Capex Down)**: Tailwind for Defensives (Staples, Health Care).

**2. Systemic Risk Awareness (Extreme Crisis Only)**:
- **Condition**: If MULTIPLE macro signals simultaneously indicate EXTREME crisis (e.g., Yield Curve Deeply Inverted AND Capex Crashing AND CLI Falling).
- **Action**: **MODERATE CAUTION** (Not Full Override).
  - Acknowledge macro headwinds but respect Tier 1 Momentum signals.
  - Apply minor reduction (-0.005 to -0.01) on cyclical Long positions.
  - Slightly favor defensive sectors if Tier 1 signals are neutral.
  - *Rationale*: Price action (Tier 1) often leads macro data. Do NOT blindly override momentum.

**3. Multi-Factor Synthesis Logic (Combining T1 + T2 + T3)**:

- **The "Convergence" (Maximum Conviction)**:
  - **Context**: All three layers align perfectly.
  - **Condition**: **Tier 1 (Strong Trend)** + **Tier 2 (High Quality/Value)** + **Tier 3 (Macro Tailwind)**.
  - **Action**: **Aggressive Long**. Use maximum allowed conviction.
  - *Reasoning*: The sector is leading price, has solid numbers, and the economy supports it.

- **The "Divergence" (Respect Price Action)**:
  - **Context**: Price is moving against the Macro logic.
  - **Condition**: **Tier 1 (Strong Trend)** + **Tier 3 (Macro Headwind)**.
  - **Action**: **Prioritize Tier 1**. Maintain the Long view with only minor adjustment (-0.005 max).
  - *Reasoning*: "Don't fight the tape." Price often leads fundamentals. Macro headwinds are noted but not overriding.

- **The "Value Trap" Caution**:
  - **Context**: Cheap valuations in a bad economy.
  - **Condition**: **Tier 2 (Deep Value Rank)** + **Tier 3 (Macro Headwind)** + **Tier 1 (Weak)**.
  - **Action**: **Maintain Tier 1 View**. Do not force a long based solely on value rank.
  - *Reasoning*: Sectors are cheap for a reason. Respect Tier 1 weakness. Value rank alone is insufficient.

- **The "Quality Shield"**:
  - **Context**: Macro is uncertain/neutral.
  - **Condition**: **Tier 3 (Neutral/Mixed)**.
  - **Action**: **Prioritize Tier 1, with Tier 2 as tiebreaker**. Use Quality Rank to refine conviction when Tier 1 signals are similar.

**4. Final Output Calibration**:
- **Holistic Review**: Does the final set of 5-6 pairs tell a consistent story? (e.g., If you are betting on a "Boom," you shouldn't be heavily Long Defensives).
- **Ranking**: Rank the final pairs based on how many "Green Lights" (T1, T2, T3) they have. 3 Green Lights = Top Rank.

### COMMON RULES (All Tiers)

**View Construction**:
- Count: Maximum 5 pairs. No fixed minimum (Quality > Quantity). No duplicate
- Each sector can appear max 2 times across all pairs
- relative_return_view range: -0.05 to +0.05 (realistic)
 - **Note**: Use decimal format. (e.g., a +2.5% expected relative return = `0.025`)
- Rank pairs by conviction (highest first)

**Quality Checks**:
- Avoid contradiction (same sector both Long and Short)
- Ensure views are actionable (not too small, not too large)
- Consider sector correlations (avoid redundant pairs like Energy Long + Materials Long vs same Short) /
