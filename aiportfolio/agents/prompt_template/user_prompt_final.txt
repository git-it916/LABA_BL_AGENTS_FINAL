[Instruction]
Analyze all provided data blocks according to your system prompt rules.
Your analysis must be progressive:
- If only Return Data is provided, generate views based on it (Stage 1).
- If Accounting Data is also provided, integrate it with Return Data to refine the views (Stage 2).
- If Macro Data is also provided, perform the final integrated analysis using all three data blocks (Stage 3).

[Reasoning Request]
Important: After you provide the main JSON output (as required by the system prompt), add a section starting with "## Reasoning" and briefly explain (in Korean) *only* the key factors and step-by-step logic (based on the Guidelines **for the highest stage you just analyzed**) that led you to select the top 5 pairs.

This entire reasoning part must be separate from and come *after* the JSON block.
